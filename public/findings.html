  <h1>Our top 10 findings </h1>
  <ol reversed>
    <li>The hidden attribute is not supported in IE10 or earlier versions.
    <li>Div has no special meaning and should only be used when no other appropriate grouping element exists.
    <li>The article tag does not have a defined heading tag and should instead use h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings.
    <li>The h1 element should be solely used as a top-level heading, since h1 elements are treated as top-level headings by many screen readers and other tools.
    <li>Many HTML tags (e.g. the &lt;li&gt; tag) can have their end tags omitted when a similar tag immediately succeeds it, which improves readability of HTML source files.
    <li>The global attribute accesskey may be blocked by browsers to protect the user from loading unsafe scripts; as a result, the user may have to manually enable the loading of the scripts through their browser.
    <li>Many input types (e.g. time, date, datetime) are not supported in all browsers and should be thoroughly tested or replaced with a polyfill.
    <li>W3C specifications provide very specific scenarios for the use of image metadata semantics in order to cover a broad base of use cases and browsers.
    <li>Link attributes and types allow authors to provide nuanced definitions of their site's relationship to internal and external resources on the Web. 
    <li>Many HTML text level elements perform the same types of markup, but have very different nuances based on W3C semantic guidelines.
